# Statistical Detective: The Benford's Law
This project explores **Benford's Law**, a fascinating mathematical phenomenon that predicts the distribution of leading digits in real-world numerical datasets. The law finds applications in various domains, including fraud detection, statistical analysis, and anomaly identification.

## Overview
Benford’s Law observes that in many naturally occurring datasets, the first digit is more likely to be small (e.g., 1 appears more often than 9). This project delves into the history, definition, and applications of Benford's Law, supported by real-world examples and statistical testing.

## Features
- **Introduction to Benford's Law**:
  - Historical context from Simon Newcomb's observations to Frank Benford's extensive validation.
  - Theoretical definition and mathematical formulation.
- **Applications**:
  - Fraud detection in finance and trade.
  - Analysis of datasets such as COVID-19 statistics, stock market capitalizations, and population data.
  - Verification of natural and astronomical datasets.
- **Statistical Testing**:
  - Implementation of goodness-of-fit tests like Chi-Square, Kolmogorov-Smirnov, and Anderson-Darling to verify adherence to Benford's Law.
  - Analysis of compliance for various distributions, including Uniform, Normal, Exponential, and more.
- **Real-World Case Studies**:
  - Village-wise population from Indian Census data.
  - Market capitalizations of top companies on NSE.
  - Runs scored by Sachin Tendulkar.

## Key Components
- **PDF Document**:
  - Comprehensive explanation of Benford's Law, supported by graphs, mathematical proofs, and datasets.
  - Visual representations of statistical conformity across datasets.
- **Code and Analysis**:
  - R-based statistical methods to test datasets against Benford’s Law.
  - Visualization of results for leading-digit distribution.
